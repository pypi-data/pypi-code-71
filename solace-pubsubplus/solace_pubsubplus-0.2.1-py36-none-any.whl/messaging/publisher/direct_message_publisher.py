This module contains classes for direct message publishers.

A direct message publisher must be created using
:py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.direct_message_publisher_builder.DirectMessagePublisherBuilder`. The
DirectMessagePublisher instance is used to publish direct messages created by a
:py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder`. The topic (or destination)
can be added when the message is a published.

The direct message publisher may also be use to publish simple messages containing only a bytearray or string payload.

        Set the specified ``PublishFailureListener`` to listen for a provided instance of the publisher.

        A :py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.direct_message_publisher.PublishFailureListener` is notified
        through it's defined callback whenever a publish message attempt fails asynchronously.

        Published messages can be queued for later transmission when the transport is flow-controlled.  If queued
        messages cannot be published, the ``PublishFailureListener`` - if one is registered - is notified.
        The PubSub+ event broker can also reject messages which appear as rejection notices on the
        specified``PublishFailureListener``.
